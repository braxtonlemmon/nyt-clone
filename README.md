# Positioning Elements Project
Project based on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements) curriculum. The project involves replicating a New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) using CSS positioning methods (Grid, Flexbox, float, etc.)

Additionally, I focused on learning to use Firefox Developer Edition tools to work with CSS Grid properties.
